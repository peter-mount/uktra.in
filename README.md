# uktra.in website

This is the replacement for the uktra.in website, rewritten from scratch.

It utilises the new microservices contained within the other projects on github to provide the data, acting simply as a frontend to those services.

## working so far

* Timetable searches, viewing individual schedules as provided by nr-timetable
* Station index & basic landing pages again using nr-timetable.
* CMS static content.

This is a work in progress but now the pages are starting to appear, the other parts of the site won't take long.
